# Electromagnetics
This project contains the code developed for calculation of scattering, near-fields and PDOS in multilayered cylinders. The method behind the algorithm is described in Chapter 3 of the attached thesis.The algorithm is divided into three functions which has been coded in Matlab. The first algorithm, Cly2D ML coeff.m, calculates the scattering coefficients, Aln and Bnl , from Equation 3.3. The second, Cly2D ML PW.m, calculates the scattering cross section, absorption cross section and near-field intensity under planewave excitation, as described in Section 3.2.1. The third algorithm, Cly2D ML PS.m, calculates the PDOS and local fields under point source excitation, as described in Section 3.2.2.
